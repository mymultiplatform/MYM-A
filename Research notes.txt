Arch and Garch models are used to predict volatility,
that is important because volatility helps us determine our
error sizes for deep error analysis.

Arch models do NOT have a beysian optimization process within,
that is why Garch exists in order to provide "constantly updatijng aspect".

Arch vs. Garch: 

ARCH (Rolling Standard Deviation version):

Uses equal weights
Only uses past squared residuals
Cuts off after a fixed number of days (like 22 days)

GARCH:

Uses declining weights that never reach zero
Includes THREE components:

Long run average variance
Current period's predicted variance
Most recent squared residual


THESE WEIGHTS and parameters are optimal when they are below 1 and above 0 (so never negative or above 1)

W(omega) = variance * weights (1-a-B)

a(alpha) = Rounded STD

B(beta) = Rounded Mean
